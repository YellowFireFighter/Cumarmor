## Installation  

### Requirements  
- Python 3.9+  
- MySQL server  
- Pip packages:  
```bash
pip install discord.py mysql-connector-python tornado requests
```  

### Setup  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Cumarmor.git  
cd Cumarmor
```  

2. **Configure MySQL**  
Make sure your MySQL server is running and accessible. Edit your database credentials in the Python files:  
```python
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="root",
  password="root",
  auth_plugin='mysql_native_password',
  pool_name = "sqlpool",
  pool_size = 3
)
```  

3. **Start the Services**  
Run the Discord bot and the Tornado server. You can do this in separate threads or terminal instances. The bot handles key generation, and the server validates them.

---

## Usage  
- Admins can generate keys through Discord using commands (not included here for security).  
- Users submit their key through a Roblox GUI, which sends an HTTP request to the Tornado backend.  
- The backend validates the key against the MySQL database.
